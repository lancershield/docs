# 🔴 Critical Severity

## 🧾 Definition:

 Critical hacks are severe vulnerabilities that let attackers steal large amounts of funds, take full control of the contract, or permanently break its core functionality. These bugs are usually easy to exploit and cause irreversible damage, often requiring emergency shutdowns or protocol upgrades.

## 🔐 Key Characteristics:

- **Immediate Exploitability Confirmed**: Attack vector has already been weaponized—typically via flash loans, admin overrides, or on-chain loopholes.
- **Irreversible Financial Damage**: Funds are drained, treasuries compromised, or tokenomics broken beyond recovery.
- **Protocol Compromise**: Core functions such as lending, minting, governance, or liquidations are hijacked or manipulated.
- **Full Privilege Escalation**: Attackers gain owner/admin rights or bypass access control entirely.
- **Multi-Contract Fallout**: Attack impacts integrated DeFi protocols, lending pools, oracles, or bridges.
- **Zero-Time Response Window**: Exploit completes in seconds to minutes, often in a single block.
- **Emergency Response Required**: Usually triggers multisig intervention, governance pause, or white-hat recovery attempt.

## 🚨 Required Response:

- **System Freeze**: Activate kill switch, pause contracts, or revoke proxy upgrades immediately.
- **Forensic Disclosure**: Publish step-by-step breakdown within 24 hours, including transaction trace, attacker addresses, and fund movement.
- **User Loss Assessment**: Quantify user impact and publish restitution timeline or compensation plan.
- **Governance Mobilization**: Propose emergency votes for rewinding, treasury funding, or re-deployment with hardened logic.
- **Patch and Re-Audit**: Immediate fix must be revalidated via independent security audits.
- **Reputation Containment**: Coordinate PR, legal, and investor comms to restore trust.
