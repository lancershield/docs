# ðŸ’¥ Hacks Database

This is the official open archive of real-world smart contract hacks, curated and maintained by the LancerShield community.

Each entry provides:

- Structured metadata with attacker details, entry points, exploited vectors
- Transaction breakdown and timeline of the attack
- Financial loss and impact scope
- Links to on-chain evidence and verified disclosures

## ðŸ“‚ Categories

Hacks are classified by severity using the **LancerShield Severity Framework**:

- **Critical (C)** â€“ Complete fund drain, governance seizure, or protocol-wide failure
- **High (H)** â€“ Major loss, access breach, or control bypass across multiple contracts
- **Medium (M)** â€“ Exploit under edge conditions, partial losses or targeted manipulation
- **Low (L)** â€“ Minor impact or contained incident with negligible damage
- **Informational (I)** â€“ Attempted but failed exploits, or recon-level attacks
