title: Zero Fee Manipulation 
severity: M
category: fee-evasion
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Users can bypass intended fee logic, drain bandwidth, or access premium actions for free
status: draft

versions: [">=0.6.0", "<latest"]
cwe: CWE-285
swc: SWC-136
```

## üìù Description

- Zero fee manipulation occurs when a protocol that intends to charge users for access, minting, trading, or claiming fails to properly enforce fee payment, allowing attackers or users to:
- Bypass intended transaction costs,Exploit fee exemptions or incorrectly handled `msg.value == 0` conditions.
- Access premium or limited functions for free,Conduct spam or DoS attacks due to underpriced operations.
- This flaw undermines protocol revenue, fairness, and on-chain economics ‚Äî especially in mints, swaps, airdrops, or access-gated functions.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity
function mint() external payable {
    require(msg.value >= fee, "Fee too low");
    _mint(msg.sender); // ‚ùå no fallback if msg.value == 0 and fee == 0
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step abuse:

1. A dApp enables public minting with a fee = 0.01 ETH.
2. The contract lacks proper enforcement or incorrectly handles exemptions.
3. An attacker sets up a contract to call mint() with msg.value = 0.
4. Due to unchecked edge conditions (e.g., exemption not validated), mint succeeds.
5. The attacker spams free mints, drains remaining supply, and resells on secondary markets.

**Assumptions:**

- An attacker exploits a poorly governed feeExempt flag to whitelist themselves.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

function mint() external payable {
    require(!feeExempt[msg.sender] || msg.value >= fee, "Invalid fee");
    _mint(msg.sender);
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Enforce minimum msg.value with strict checks for all fee-requiring functions.
- Do not expose feeExempt modifiers without secure admin controls or public logging.
- Default fee logic should be opt-in only via verifiable whitelists, not opt-out.

### Additional Safeguards

- Emit fee-related events (FeePaid, FeeBypassed) for traceability.
- Protect fee logic with tests that include msg.value = 0, gas limits, and edge flags.
- Deny zero-fee interactions unless explicitly authorized via signature or Merkle proof.

### Detection Methods

- Slither: fee-evasion, msg.value-zero, insecure-exemption detectors.
- Fuzz testing for all payable functions with boundary conditions.
- Unit tests enforcing fee compliance across normal and exempted users.

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: High ‚Äî bypassed fees ruin supply control and cause revenue or fairness loss.
- **Exploitability**: Moderate ‚Äî often public and can be automated by bots.
- **Reachability**: Common in payable functions or exemption patterns.
- **Complexity**: Low ‚Äî a few misplaced conditionals often cause this.
- **Detectability**: High ‚Äî easily caught with tools or test harnesses.
