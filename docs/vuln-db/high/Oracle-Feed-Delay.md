severity: H
category: oracle-manipulation
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Exploiter can use stale prices to drain or manipulate protocol logic
status: draft

versions: [">=0.6.0", "<latest"]
cwe: CWE-200
swc: SWC-119
```

## üìù Description

- Oracle feed delay exploits occur when a smart contract depends on external oracle prices (e.g., Chainlink, TWAP, custom oracles) that may become outdated or lag behind the current market state. If price updates are delayed, attackers can:
- Trade on stale prices, executing arbitrage against the true market value,
- Borrow against inflated collateral values,
- Trigger liquidations, minting, or redemptions based on incorrect assumptions.

This attack is especially effective when protocols fail to:
- Check oracle data freshness (`timestamp`),
- Use time-weighted or resistant mechanisms,
- Or gate high-impact actions during volatile updates.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity
interface IOracle {
    function getPrice() external view returns (uint256 price, uint256 lastUpdated);
}

contract OracleDelayVulnerable {
    IOracle public priceOracle;

    function buy() external payable {
        (uint256 price, uint256 updatedAt) = priceOracle.getPrice();
        // ‚ùå No freshness check
        require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient payment");
        // Mint tokens, etc.
    }
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. Attacker observes that getPrice() returns 1 ETH = $2000, but ETH has dropped to $1600.
2. Oracle has not yet updated due to delay or paused feed.
3. Attacker uses 1 ETH to buy tokens at the stale $2000 price.
4. When oracle updates, attacker sells back or exits with net profit.
5. Protocol loses funds or issues assets at overvalued prices.

**Assumptions:**

- Oracle value is outdated or updated infrequently.
- No timestamp or deviation guard in place.
- High-value logic depends directly on the price returned.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

uint256 public constant MAX_ORACLE_DELAY = 2 minutes;

function buy() external payable {
    (uint256 price, uint256 updatedAt) = priceOracle.getPrice();
    require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= MAX_ORACLE_DELAY, "Stale price");

    require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient payment");
    // Proceed with logic
}

```


## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Enforce staleness checks using oracle timestamps (e.g., Chainlink updatedAt).
- Use TWAPs, medianizers, or multi-oracle mechanisms to reduce impact of single delays.
- Apply maximum deviation limits: e.g., reject prices that change >30% in a block.

### Additional Safeguards

- Pause protocol actions if oracle becomes unreliable.
- Use Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface.latestRoundData() with timestamp checks.
- Apply circuit breakers on large transactions based on oracle conditions.

### Detection Methods

- Slither: unchecked-oracle-read, stale-data-dependency, manipulatable-oracle detectors.
- Manual audit of every function that uses oracle pricing without a freshness check.
- Simulation testing with delayed or manipulated oracle feeds.

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Major ‚Äî can drain vaults, misprice mint/burn/redemption, or abuse liquidation.
- **Exploitability**: Depends on timing oracle lag with market volatility.
- **Reachability**: Found in most DeFi protocols with external price dependency.
- **Complexity**: Medium ‚Äî needs oracle insight or trading bot.
- **Detectability**: High ‚Äî timestamp checks are well-known best practices.
