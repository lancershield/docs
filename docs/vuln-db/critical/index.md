# 🔴 Critical Severity

## 🧾 Definition:

- Indicates the highest possible risk category within the LancerShield Severity Framework (LSF). These vulnerabilities represent immediate, system-wide threats with the potential for catastrophic impact.

## 🔐 Key Characteristics:

- **Immediate Exploitability**: Can be actively exploited as-is without modification or delay.
- **Irreversible Impact**: Results in permanent loss—e.g., fund drains, bricked contracts, or governance compromise.
- **Systemic Scope**: Affects not just the target contract, but also dependent protocols, integrations, and users.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Often enables attackers to gain full admin rights or bypass all user permissions.
- **Cascading Failures**: May force emergency shutdowns, forks, paused services, or community interventions.
- **Legal & Regulatory Risk**: Triggers potential litigation, investigations, or brand damage.
- **No Workarounds**: Cannot be mitigated by off-chain measures or runtime configuration changes.

## 🚨 Required Response:

- **Patch Required**: Must be remediated prior to deployment. No exceptions.
- **Full Disclosure Logging**: Overrides must be justified and cryptographically logged for audit trails.
- **Security Freeze (if live)**: Recommend halting affected systems until resolved.
