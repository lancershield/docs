# ⚪ Informational Severity

## 🧾 Definition:

- Informational findings are non-security observations that have no impact on logic or execution. Their value is in improving audit clarity, long-term maintainability, and developer confidence.

## 🔐 Key Characteristics:

- **No Functional Risk**: Changing or ignoring the issue does not affect contract behavior.
- **Developer Clarity Issues**: Examples include unclear comments, redundant logic, or lack of NatSpec.
- **Useful for External Review**: Helps future auditors, integrators, or contributors understand intent.
- **May Signal Future Bugs**: Could become relevant if the logic changes over time.
- **Low Effort Cleanup**: Usually fixable in minutes or during documentation review.

## 🚨  Required Response:

- **Fix is Discretionary**: No required action unless aligned with internal standards.
- **Helpful for Reputation**: Cleaning these up reflects well on code quality and audit readiness.
- **Log for Devs**: Track in backlog or GitHub issues to revisit post-deployment.
