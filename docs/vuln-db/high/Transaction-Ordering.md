## üìù Description

- Transaction Ordering Dependence (TOD), also known as "front-running," is a class of vulnerabilities where the order of transactions in a block affects contract behavior, enabling attackers to profit by observing and reordering pending transactions.
- This typically arises when:
- A contract has time-sensitive or conditional logic (e.g., first-come, first-served)
- There is no mechanism to lock, commit, or protect sensitive functions
- External observers (e.g., miners, MEV bots) can simulate or monitor the mempool
- Affected patterns include:
- Auctions or reward claims favoring the first caller
- Commit-reveal games with no anti-front-running protection
- Functions that rely on temporary global state like block.timestamp or tx.origin

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

bool public claimed;

function claim() external {
    require(!claimed, "Already claimed");
    claimed = true;
    rewardToken.transfer(msg.sender, 100 * 1e18);
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. A protocol implements a one-time claim() function that rewards the first caller.
2. Alice prepares and signs her transaction, which enters the mempool.
3. A bot monitors mempool and detects Alice‚Äôs intent.
4. The bot submits a transaction with a higher gas price, front-running Alice‚Äôs tx.
5. The contract sets claimed = true in the bot‚Äôs tx; Alice‚Äôs transaction fails.
6. The bot gets the full reward, and Alice receives nothing but pays gas.

**Assumptions:**

- No commit-reveal or proof-of-intent mechanism.
- Global state is changed in a way that depends on tx ordering.
- Publicly accessible functions without per-user protection.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

mapping(address => bool) public hasClaimed;

function claim() external {
    require(!hasClaimed[msg.sender], "Already claimed");
    hasClaimed[msg.sender] = true;
    rewardToken.transfer(msg.sender, 100 * 1e18);
}
```
## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Default"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "Outcome is influenced by mempool visibility and ordering."
- context: "Public DeFi protocol with shared state logic"
  severity: C
  reasoning: "Highly exploitable via MEV searchers or validator frontrunning."
- context: "Private contracts or batch-queued execution"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Limited exposure due to controlled execution context."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Use commit-reveal schemes for time-sensitive logic.
- Implement per-user claim tracking instead of global flags.
- Delay effect execution using timelocks or randomization.

### Additional Safeguards

- Leverage priority queues instead of first tx wins.
- Use sealed-bid models for auctions or lotteries.
- Integrate with MEV protection tools (e.g., Flashbots RPC)

### Detection Methods

- Static analysis for global state flags modified in user-facing functions.
- Simulation tools for reordering attack viability.
- Tools: Slither (tx-order-dependence), MythX, Tenderly simulation
