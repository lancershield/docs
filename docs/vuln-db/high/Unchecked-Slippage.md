title: Unchecked Slippage in Multi-Hop Swaps 
baseSeverity: H

impact: User receives significantly less tokens than expected in swaps
status: draft

cwe: CWE-20
swc: SWC-118
```

## üìù Description

- Unchecked slippage in multi-hop swaps occurs when decentralized exchange (DEX) integrations perform token swaps across multiple liquidity pools (multi-hop) without enforcing a minimum output threshold (`amountOutMin`). This omission allows:
- Swaps to execute with high slippage during volatile market conditions,
- Sandwich or MEV attacks that extract value from users,
- Receivers to receive far fewer tokens than expected, resulting in silent loss.
- This issue is particularly dangerous when interacting with routers like Uniswap, SushiSwap, or PancakeSwap without setting `amountOutMin` or ignoring the return value.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity
interface IUniswapRouter {
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (uint256[] memory amounts);
}

contract SlippageUnsafe {
    IUniswapRouter public router;

    function swap(address[] calldata path, uint256 amountIn) external {
        // ‚ùå No slippage protection: amountOutMin = 0
        router.swapExactTokensForTokens(amountIn, 0, path, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step attack:

1. User attempts to swap token A to token C via token B (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC) during low liquidity.
2. Attacker front-runs the swap and manipulates the price of token B.
3. Since amountOutMin = 0, the contract accepts any output and completes the swap.
4. User receives significantly fewer tokens, attacker profits from MEV or arbitrage.

**Assumptions:**

- No minimum output check (amountOutMin) is enforced.
- Path includes volatile or illiquid tokens.
- Slippage or oracle protection is not enforced off-chain.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

function swap(address[] calldata path, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin) external {
    require(amountOutMin > 0, "Invalid slippage threshold");

    router.swapExactTokensForTokens(
        amountIn,
        amountOutMin, // ‚úÖ Enforces expected return
        path,
        msg.sender,
        block.timestamp
    );
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Default"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "Loss of value through multi-hop slippage can go undetected by users."
- context: "Aggregator contract with dynamic routing"
  severity: C
  reasoning: "Exploiters can insert illiquid tokens into path to drain value stealthily."
- context: "Trusted frontend with enforced slippage checks"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "User loss minimized when frontend or SDK sets tight bounds."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Always require user-supplied or computed amountOutMin based on off-chain price feeds or simulations.
- Validate slippage tolerances (e.g., 1%, 0.5%) based on estimated route output.
- Consider quoting with getAmountsOut() before executing the swap.

### Additional Safeguards

- Add UI warnings and slippage selectors in dApp frontend.
- Integrate oracle feeds to detect price deviation from real-time market data.
- Use TWAP oracles or guarded pricing mechanisms in critical contracts.

### Detection Methods

- Slither: dex-integration-no-slippage-check, zero-min-amount, swap-unchecked detectors.
- Manual audit of all swapExactTokensForTokens, swapExactETHForTokens, or similar functions.
- Fuzz testing with manipulated DEX state to simulate low-liquidity attacks.

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: High ‚Äî causes immediate value loss due to bad pricing.
- **Exploitability**: High ‚Äî easily targeted by bots when no slippage guard is present.
- **Reachability**: Seen in custom routers, farm rewards, and auto-compounders.
- **Complexity**: Low ‚Äî typical oversight during integration.
- **Detectability**: High ‚Äî audit tools flag this pattern, and it is visually evident.
