cwe: CWE-358
swc: SWC-114
```

## üìù Description

- A sandwich attack is a form of Miner Extractable Value (MEV) exploitation where an attacker front-runs and back-runs a user's transaction to extract arbitrage profit. 
- This occurs primarily in automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap, SushiSwap, or custom DEX contracts when:
- The contract allows trades without slippage protection
- The attacker can observe the pending user transaction in the public mempool
- The protocol exposes price-setting logic before the state update
- In a sandwich attack:
- The attacker places a buy order before the user‚Äôs transaction (front-run), pushing the price up.
- The user executes at a worse price.
- The attacker sells immediately after (back-run) to capture the spread.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleDEX {
    uint256 public tokenReserve = 1000 ether;
    uint256 public ethReserve = 100 ether;

    function buyTokens() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "No ETH sent");

        uint256 tokensOut = (msg.value * tokenReserve) / (ethReserve + msg.value);
        tokenReserve -= tokensOut;
        ethReserve += msg.value;

        // ‚ùå No slippage control
        _transfer(msg.sender, tokensOut);
    }

    function _transfer(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        // token transfer logic
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

1. Alice sends a buyTokens() transaction with 10 ETH.
2. The attacker observes this in the mempool.
3. The attacker sends a buyTokens() tx with 100 ETH just before Alice's.
4. Alice‚Äôs transaction executes after the price has shifted, so she gets fewer tokens than expected.
5. The attacker back-runs with a sellTokens() to dump at a higher price.
6. Attacker extracts profit at the expense of Alice‚Äôs slippage.

**Assumptions:**

- Transaction is publicly visible in mempool.
- No max slippage or deadline set by the user.
- Price-setting logic is exposed to pre-execution analysis.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SafeDEX {
    uint256 public tokenReserve = 1000 ether;
    uint256 public ethReserve = 100 ether;

    function buyTokens(uint256 minTokensOut) external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "No ETH sent");

        uint256 tokensOut = (msg.value * tokenReserve) / (ethReserve + msg.value);
        require(tokensOut >= minTokensOut, "Slippage too high"); // ‚úÖ slippage check

        tokenReserve -= tokensOut;
        ethReserve += msg.value;

        _transfer(msg.sender, tokensOut);
    }

    function _transfer(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        // token transfer logic
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Default"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "Applicable across all AMM-based DeFi transactions where slippage is poorly configured."
- context: "Sophisticated users using Flashbots RPC"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Attack surface greatly reduced through private mempool routing."
- context: "Mobile/web frontend auto-generated swaps"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "These systems often set loose slippage by default, making users vulnerable."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Require minAmountOut or maxAmountIn parameters in all swap functions.
- Reject trades if slippage exceeds acceptable bounds.

### Additional Safeguards

- Use deadline/expiry timestamps in user-submitted orders.
- Encourage users to route orders through MEV-protected relayers (e.g., Flashbots Protect).
- Consider adding randomized delays or batching to reduce predictability.

### Detection Methods

- Review swap functions for missing slippage bounds or deadlines.
- Simulate MEV attacks in forked testnets.
- Tools: Slither (unbounded-slippage), MythX, Foundry gas differential tests

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Users overpay or lose funds to MEV bots exploiting slippage.
- **Exploitability**: Mempool bots and priority gas auctions make this easy.
- **Reachability**: Frequent in DEXs and swap logic that lacks slippage bounds.
- **Complexity**: Moderate effort, widely deployed via MEV searchers.
- **Detectability**: Easily audited via static tools and mempool analysis.
