```YAML
id: LS05C
title: Liquidity Rug  
baseSeverity: C
category: access-control
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Protocol liquidity can be drained suddenly, leaving users unable to trade or withdraw
status: draft
complexity: medium
attack_vector: internal

versions: [">=0.5.0", "<latest"]
cwe: CWE-285
swc: SWC-100
```

## üìù Description

- Liquidity rug refers to a scenario in decentralized finance (DeFi) where liquidity providers or users deposit tokens into a protocol (e.g., DEX, staking contract, vault).
- The contract owner, deployer, or privileged account can remove all or a large portion of the pooled assets, often without user consent or transparency. 
- Loss of funds or token value collapse,Broken trading pairs and stuck LP tokens, Destroyed user trust and ecosystem credibility.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity
contract LPVault {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public lpToken;

    function emergencyWithdraw() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        lpToken.transfer(owner, lpToken.balanceOf(address(this))); // ‚ùå Entire pool drained by admin
    }
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step:

1. Users deposit LP tokens into a staking or farming contract to earn rewards.
2. Owner calls emergencyWithdraw() without user notification or restriction.
3. The contract transfers 100% of the LP tokens to the owner.
4. Users attempting to withdraw now face zero liquidity and cannot recover funds.

**Assumptions:**

- The smart contract holds user-deposited liquidity (e.g., LP tokens, stablecoins, or staking assets).
- There exists an admin-controlled function (e.g., withdraw(), emergencyWithdraw(), sweep()) .
- Allows transfer of all or a significant portion of pooled tokens, and
- Is either callable by the deployer/owner/multisig without user consent or governance delay.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

function emergencyWithdraw() external onlyGovernance {
    require(block.timestamp > emergencyUnlockTime, "Emergency not active");
    uint256 ownerShare = lpToken.balanceOf(address(this)) / 10; // ‚úÖ Limited withdrawal
    lpToken.transfer(governance, ownerShare);
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Retail-facing token with centralized liquidity control"
  severity: C
  reasoning: "Owner can remove liquidity at any time, causing total loss for users."
- context: "Liquidity burned or locked in time-locked contract"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Risk significantly reduced if proper lock mechanism is in place."
- context: "DAO-controlled liquidity pool"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "DAO may still vote to rug, but it's visible and time-delayed."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Never allow unrestricted admin access to pooled liquidity.
-  DAO-based withdrawal approval or timelocks for emergency functions.
- Cap emergency withdrawals (e.g., max 10‚Äì20% of total pool).

### Additional Safeguards

- Emit EmergencyWithdrawalTriggered events with reason and governance signature.
- Implement governance delay via contracts like TimelockController.
- Disclose all privileged functions in UI and audits.

### Detection Methods

- Slither: access-control-unrestricted, admin-sweep, emergency-withdraw detectors.
- Manual code audit of functions with transfer, transferFrom, sweep, or withdrawAll.
- Look for use of msg.sender == owner with no further restrictions.
