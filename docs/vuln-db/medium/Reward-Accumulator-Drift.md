```

## üìù Description

- Reward Accumulator Drift is a subtle logic flaw in staking and farming contracts where a protocol uses an accumulator-based reward model (e.g., accRewardPerShare) but:
- Fails to update global or per-user accumulators precisely,
- Introduces rounding errors that compound over time, or
- Omits updates under specific edge cases.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

uint256 public accRewardPerShare;
uint256 public totalStaked;
mapping(address => uint256) public rewardDebt;

function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
    totalStaked += amount;
    userStakes[msg.sender] += amount;
    rewardDebt[msg.sender] = userStakes[msg.sender] * accRewardPerShare / 1e12;
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. A protocol uses accRewardPerShare to track cumulative rewards.
2. The contract only updates this variable when harvest() or massUpdate() is called.
3. A new user deposits a large amount just before rewards are updated, and gets rewardDebt based on an outdated accumulator.
4. When the pool is updated later, the user‚Äôs rewards are over-allocated.
5. Over time, as more users enter/exit and the pool is inconsistently updated, accumulator drift accumulates, causing misaligned payouts.
6. Eventually, rewards run out early or some users earn significantly more/less than intended.

**Assumptions:**

- The protocol uses accumulator-based reward accounting (accRewardPerShare model).
- Rewards are not updated consistently before every user action (deposit/withdraw/harvest).

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

function updatePool() internal {
    if (totalStaked == 0) return;
    uint256 rewards = getPendingRewards();
    accRewardPerShare += rewards * 1e12 / totalStaked;
}

function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
    updatePool(); // ‚úÖ update before user state changes
    totalStaked += amount;
    userStakes[msg.sender] += amount;
    rewardDebt[msg.sender] = userStakes[msg.sender] * accRewardPerShare / 1e12;
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Default"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "Can cause moderate economic deviation if left unchecked."
- context: "High-volume yield farming pool"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "High impact due to rapid user churn and large reward sums."
- context: "Single-staker testnet deployment"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Minimal economic loss and test-only use."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Always call updatePool() before user state transitions (deposit, withdraw, harvest).
- Use high-precision scaling factors (e.g., 1e12) and fixed-point libraries.
- Design test cases for edge time gaps and batch reward updates.

### Additional Safeguards

- Track lastUpdateTime and assert it increases monotonically.
- Simulate long-term drift using fuzzing tools (e.g., Foundry, Echidna).
- Cap max reward per block to prevent overflow or over-allocation.

### Detection Methods

- Invariant testing: total rewards distributed == expected emission
- Compare accumulated rewards to actual token transfers
- Tools: Foundry, Slither (unused-params, incorrect-calculation), Dedaub‚Äôs invariant suite

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Can result in protocol overpaying or underpaying rewards, distorting emission schedules.
- **Exploitability**: Strategic users may time interactions to take advantage of stale accumulators.
- **Reachability**: Nearly all DeFi staking/farming contracts use similar reward accounting logic.
- **Complexity**: Caused by state ordering or precision loss, not complicated exploits.
- **Detectability**: Requires test coverage with delayed updates and timing-based fuzzing.
