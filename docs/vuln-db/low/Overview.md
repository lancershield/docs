# ðŸŸ¢ Low Severity #

- Minor issues that do not result in immediate financial loss or protocol compromise.

- Often related to code quality, developer best practices, or non-critical inefficiencies.

- May include things like improper event logging, unused variables, or lack of input validation on non-sensitive functions.

- Generally non-exploitable or only exploitable under rare, controlled conditions.

- Fixes are recommended to improve maintainability, audit clarity, or prevent future escalation.

- Low severity issues do not impact core logic or asset flows, but cleaning them up contributes to long-term protocol security hygiene.
