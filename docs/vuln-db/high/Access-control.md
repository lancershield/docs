# Access Control Vulnerabilities

``` YAML
id: TBA
title:  Access Control on Sensitive Functions
severity: H
category: access-control
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Unauthorized state or asset manipulation
status: draft
complexity: medium
attack_vector: external
mitigation_difficulty: easy
versions: [">=0.4.0", "<0.8.21"]
cwe: CWE-284
swc: SWC-105
```

## 📝 Description

- Access control vulnerabilities occur when critical functions—such as fund withdrawals, admin configuration, or token minting—lack proper permission checks. 
- In Ethereum smart contracts, this often results from failing to restrict access with `onlyOwner`, role-based modifiers, or faulty logic in `msg.sender` comparisons. 
- Attackers can exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized control over privileged operations.

## 🚨 Vulnerable Code

```solidity
contract Vault {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function withdrawAll() external {
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance); // No access check
    }

    function setAdmin(address _newAdmin) external {
        admin = _newAdmin; // Anyone can call this
    }
}
```


## 🧪 Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. Attacker calls setAdmin() and sets themselves as the admin.
2. Attacker then calls withdrawAll() and drains the contract balance.
3. No access checks prevent unauthorized access to critical logic.

**Assumptions:**

- No onlyOwner/require(msg.sender == admin) present.
- No role-based access control using AccessControl or similar libraries.

## ✅ Fixed Code

```solidity

contract SecureVault is Ownable {
    constructor() {
        transferOwnership(msg.sender);
    }

    function withdrawAll() external onlyOwner {
        payable(owner()).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function setAdmin(address _newAdmin) external onlyOwner {
        transferOwnership(_newAdmin);
    }
}
```


## 🛡️ Prevention

### Primary Defenses
- Use OpenZeppelin’s Ownable or AccessControl libraries.
- Enforce onlyOwner or onlyRole modifiers on privileged functions.
- Validate msg.sender against trusted addresses before sensitive actions.

### Additional Safeguards

- Consider multi-sig wallets for admin operations.
- Use timelocks for critical governance updates.
- Monitor on-chain admin function calls.

### Detection Methods

- Slither: access-control, missing-authorization detectors.
- MythX, Mythril: symbolic analysis of control flow and privilege escalations.
- Manual auditing with threat modeling and function-level review.

## 📄 Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Loss of control, unauthorized withdrawals, or contract destruction.

- **Exploitability**: One call to an unprotected admin function can cause catastrophic failure.

- **Reachability**: Admin-like functions are usually public or external.

- **Complexity**: Little to no complexity if permission checks are missing.

- **Detectability**: Well-known tools like Slither and Mythril detect most access issues, but subtle logic bugs may evade detection.
