cwe: CWE-704
swc: SWC-135
```

## üìù Description

- Insufficient Fee Logic in DEXs occurs when a decentralized exchange implements flawed or incomplete fee calculation mechanisms, often due to:
- Incorrect math for fee deduction (e.g., using multiplication before division)
- Rounding errors in percentage-based calculations
- Failing to deduct or enforce minimum fee amounts
- Allowing users to bypass fee logic entirely via custom routes or zero-fee paths

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

function swap(uint256 amountIn, address tokenIn, address tokenOut) external {
    uint256 fee = amountIn * 3 / 1000; // ‚ùå vulnerable to rounding errors
    uint256 amountAfterFee = amountIn - fee;
    // Perform swap using amountAfterFee
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. A DEX calculates the fee as amountIn * 3 / 1000, truncating decimals.
2. An attacker sends repeated swaps with amountIn = 1 token.
3. Due to integer rounding, fee = 0 for each trade.
4. By batching small trades, the attacker achieves high-volume routing without paying fees.
5. The protocol loses revenue, and arbitrage bots exploit the system continuously.

**Assumptions:**

- Fee is calculated with integer math and truncates small values.
- There is no minimum fee enforcement (e.g., require(fee > 0)).
- The attacker can interact with the DEX via custom scripts or smart contracts.
- The fee logic is embedded in swap or liquidity provision code and affects economic incentives.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

function swap(uint256 amountIn, address tokenIn, address tokenOut) external {
    uint256 fee = (amountIn * 3 + 999) / 1000; // ‚úÖ rounding up
    require(fee > 0, "Fee too small");
    uint256 amountAfterFee = amountIn - fee;
    // proceed with amountAfterFee
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "DEX operating on mainnet without enforced fees or slippage protection"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "Sustainable protocol revenue model is broken; exploitable by arbitrage"
- context: "DEX in private testnet or sandboxed environment"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "No economic impact outside developer context"
- context: "DEX uses dynamic fee model with governance limits"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "Impact reduced via circuit breakers or treasury safeguards"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Use fixed-point math libraries (e.g., SafeMath, FixedPoint) to avoid rounding errors.
- Round fees up, not down, and enforce minimum fee thresholds.
- Log and monitor per-trade fee amounts to detect micro-exploit patterns.

### Additional Safeguards

- Apply require(fee > 0) and cap max trades per block or per user.
- Penalize or rate-limit low-fee trades on high-volume addresses.
- Use unit testing and fuzzing to simulate edge cases (1‚Äì10 wei trades).

### Detection Methods

- Slither: incorrect-math, insufficient-fee-check
- Manual audit of fee math for truncation or unchecked zero results
- Tools: Echidna, Foundry fuzzing with minimal input sizes

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Undermines protocol economics, impacting both fees and LP ROI.
- **Exploitability**: Attackers can batch trades or simulate fees to find zero-fee edge cases.
- **Reachability**: Affects core swap paths in most DEX implementations.
- **Complexity**: Moderate; knowledge of math rounding needed.
- **Detectability**: Static analysis, simulation, or monitoring required to detect subtle effects.
