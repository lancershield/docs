## üìù Description

- Gas fee arbitrage refers to exploiting differences in gas cost, gas refunds, and transaction ordering to extract economic value from smart contracts. Attackers can:
- Craft transactions that manipulate state just to trigger costly logic (e.g., expensive SSTORE or SELFDESTRUCT)
- Front-run or sandwich legitimate users with low-cost, high-return gas operations
- Exploit gas refund loopholes to get partial gas back while still affecting state
- Inflate gas usage to cause denial-of-service or discourage interaction
- Protocols that tie logic execution or economic outcomes to gas usage (e.g., reward calculations, token issuance per gas burnt) are especially vulnerable.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GasReward {
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastBlockUsed;

    function claimReward() external {
        require(block.number > lastBlockUsed[msg.sender], "Already claimed");

        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        // expensive computation (could be griefed)
        for (uint i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            assembly { mstore(0x0, i) }
        }

        uint256 gasUsed = gasStart - gasleft();
        uint256 reward = gasUsed * tx.gasprice; // ‚ùå ties reward to gas cost
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(reward);
        lastBlockUsed[msg.sender] = block.number;
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

1. A user identifies a contract that refunds gas or pays users based on gasUsed * gasprice.
2. They craft a transaction with:
3. Large loops or dummy state writes to increase gasUsed
4. High gasprice with base fee control under EIP-1559
5. They trigger claimReward() repeatedly, draining ETH from the contract.
6. In MEV scenarios, this can be sandwiched around user transactions or bundled into private blocks for profit.

**Assumptions:**

- Contract rewards or penalizes based on gasUsed or tx.gasprice
- No upper bounds, caps, or sanity checks are enforced

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SafeGasReward {
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastBlockUsed;

    uint256 public constant MAX_REWARD = 0.01 ether;

    function claimReward() external {
        require(block.number > lastBlockUsed[msg.sender], "Already claimed");
        uint256 reward = MAX_REWARD; // ‚úÖ fixed cap
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(reward);
        lastBlockUsed[msg.sender] = block.number;
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Protocol uses gas reimbursement with no refund or abuse protection"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "Abuse results in token drain or unsustainable incentive model"
- context: "Gas reimbursements capped, validated, or audited"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Exposure significantly reduced by proper accounting"
- context: "No gas-based rewards or all txs use `msg.sender` payment"
  severity: I
  reasoning: "No vector for abuse exists"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Avoid rewarding based on gasUsed, tx.gasprice, or similar low-level metrics.
- Cap dynamic computations with MAX_REWARD, MAX_GAS_USED, etc.

### Additional Safeguards

- Use Chainlink feeds or off-chain logic for reward rates.
- Add gas usage audits or runtime enforcement of limits.
- Implement EIP-3529 awareness (gas refund limitations)

### Detection Methods

- Look for tx.gasprice, gasleft(), and gas-based calculations in financial logic.
- Simulate transactions with artificially inflated gasprice or block congestion.
- Tools: Slither (gas-related logic), MythX, fuzzing

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Allows attacker to extract value or deny access by manipulating gas.
- **Exploitability**: Feasible via smart transaction design or private bundles.
- **Reachability**: Found in game loops, gas refunds, reward multipliers, etc.
- **Complexity**: Moderate‚Äîno protocol break needed, just smart gas manipulation.
- **Detectability**: Easy to catch with static tools or code audit.
