swc: SWC-128: DoS With Block Gas Limit
```

## üìù Description

- Unbounded loops occur when a smart contract executes a for or while loop over a dynamically-sized data structure (e.g., array.length, mapping, or user-set list) without limiting the number of iterations. On blockchains with gas limits, this can lead to:
- Out-of-gas (OOG) errors
- Permanent DoS for functions like withdraw() or claimRewards()
- System-wide failure to execute core logic

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

address[] public stakers;

function distributeRewards() external onlyOwner {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < stakers.length; i++) {
        rewards[stakers[i]] += 100;
    }
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. A staking contract records all participants in a growing address[] stakers array.
2. distributeRewards() is designed to reward all users in one loop.
3. The platform gains popularity; stakers grow to 5,000+ addresses.
4. When the owner calls distributeRewards(), it fails due to gas exhaustion.
5. No rewards are distributed, and the system is effectively locked.

**Assumptions:**

- The contract uses loops over dynamic arrays or mappings without upper bounds.
- The loop logic affects critical functionality such as withdrawals, claims, or updates.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

function distributeRewardsBatch(uint256 start, uint256 end) external onlyOwner {
    require(end <= stakers.length, "Invalid range");
    for (uint256 i = start; i < end; i++) {
        rewards[stakers[i]] += 100;
    }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Avoid writing loops over user-controlled dynamic data.
- Use pull-based patterns instead of global state mutation.
- Introduce batching, limits, or checkpoints to control loop size.

### Additional Safeguards

- Include require(gasleft() > X) logic if nearing gas-critical operations.
- Use off-chain scripts or subgraphs to process bulk logic safely.
- Simulate max loop sizes during unit testing.

### Detection Methods

- Slither: unbounded-loop, calls-loop-array-length
- Manual review of loops over array.length, mapping keys, etc.
- Fuzzing with large inputs to observe gas ceiling

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Funds become stuck or actions fail due to OOG errors in core logic.
- **Exploitability**: Anyone can increase data size (e.g., via deposits) and trigger failure.
- **Reachability**: Common in farming, staking, and governance contracts.
- **Complexity**: Basic design flaw; doesn‚Äôt require technical skill to abuse.
- **Detectability**: Static tools like Slither flag these reliably.
