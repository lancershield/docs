# LancerShield Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation hub for **LancerShield** - your AI-powered platform for smart contract auditing, vulnerability detection, and secure development.


## Why LancerShield?

Smart contract security is critical - and costly to get wrong. LancerShield aims to modernize smart contract security with an integrated approach that combines:

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection** - Static analysis with low false positives, powered by Slither and enhanced by AI reasoning.
- **Function-Level CVR (Causal Vulnerability Reasoning)** - AI-generated explanations that trace exploit chains and identify root causes.
- **Confidence-Scored Findings** - Every issue is rated with a certainty level and reasoning, so you know where to focus.
- **Developer-Friendly Fixes & Docs** - Clear, editable fix suggestions and markdown audit reports you can act on immediately.

Whether you're a solo dev or a protocol team, this documentation is your open knowledge foundation.


## What You'll Find Here

- üîç **Severity Framework**  
  Understand our standardized classification system (LSF) for ranking vulnerabilities from Informational to Critical.

- üß† **Vulnerability Database**  
  Explore real-world vulnerability patterns, categorized with before/after code, causes, and preventions.

- ü§ù **Contributing Guide**  
  Help us expand the open knowledge base. Learn how to submit new vulnerabilities, improvements, and fixes.


## How LancerShield Is Unique

**LancerShield isn‚Äôt just a scanner ‚Äî it‚Äôs a security co-pilot built for real-world smart contract development**.
Here‚Äôs what sets us apart from traditional audit tools and generic static analyzers:

- **AI-Augmented Vulnerability Detection**
  Goes beyond signatures and regex by reasoning through code execution paths using a context-aware AI engine.

- **LancerShield Severity Framework (LSF)**
  Proprietary, weighted scoring system that standardizes severity evaluation across audits ‚Äî fully explainable, adaptable, and override-aware.

- **Zero-Trust Override Logging**
  Every manual severity override is logged cryptographically with user ID, timestamp, and diff ‚Äî building trust through transparency.

- **Continuously-Evolving Threat Intelligence**
  Our vulnerability engine is enriched with real-world exploit data, bug bounty insights, and ecosystem telemetry ‚Äî constantly learning.
  
- **Token + Protocol Specificity**
  LancerShield adapts to ERC patterns, DeFi primitives, upgradeable contracts, and even cross-chain trust assumptions.
  

## Our Mission & Goals

**Our mission is to modernize smart contract security for the speed and scale of today‚Äôs web3 development**.
We believe security should be:

- **Shifted Left**‚Äì empowering devs to catch critical bugs before audits or mainnet deployment.
- **Explainable by Default** ‚Äì offering clear reasoning for each flagged issue, not just raw findings.
- **Open & Evolving** ‚Äì shaped by contributors, external researchers, and production-grade insights.
- **Developer-Centric** ‚Äì bridging the gap between raw vulnerability data and actionable code fixes.
  
### Our Strategic Goals

- **Cut Time-to-Remediation by 50%** for high-impact bugs through automated prioritization.
- **Standardize Risk Across Audits** with the LSF scoring engine adopted by multiple teams.
- **Power Ecosystem Trust** by maintaining a transparent, collaborative, and up-to-date vulnerability knowledge base.
- **Enable Continuous Security** ‚Äî not once-per-release audits, but embedded detection in every commit.
