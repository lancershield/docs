# 🐞 Vulnerability Database

This is the official open knowledge base of real-world smart contract vulnerabilities curated by the LancerShield community.

Each entry contains:

- A structured metadata frontmatter
- Human-readable explanation
- Minimal working examples of the vulnerable and fixed code
- Exploit scenario and prevention strategies

---

## 📂 Categories

Vulnerabilities are grouped under severity levels using the [LancerShield Severity Framework](../severity-framework/index.md):

- **Critical (C)** – Total fund loss, contract destruction, or irreversible takeover
- **High (H)** – Large-scale theft or persistent unauthorized access
- **Medium (M)** – Exploitable under certain conditions or state assumptions
- **Low (L)** – Minor misbehavior or best-practice violations
- **Informational (I)** – Non-exploitable or stylistic notes
- **Gas (G)** – Optimization opportunities, not security flaws
