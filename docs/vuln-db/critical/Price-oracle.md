# Price Oracle Manipulation

```YAML
id:  LS01C
title: Price Oracle Manipulation
baseSeverity: C
category: oracle-manipulation
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Mispriced trades, loans, and liquidations
status: draft
complexity: medium

versions: [">=0.4.0", "<0.8.21"]
cwe: CWE-345
swc: SWC-114
```

## üìù Description

- Price Oracle Manipulation occurs when an attacker influences the data source a smart contract relies on for pricing assets.
- If the oracle uses manipulable inputs‚Äîsuch as on-chain DEX prices, thin liquidity pools, or manipulable off-chain data feeds‚Äîan attacker can trick the contract into believing an incorrect asset price.
- This results in faulty calculations in lending protocols, AMMs, liquidations, and more.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity
interface IPriceFeed {
    function getPrice(address token) external view returns (uint);
}

contract Lending {
    IPriceFeed public oracle;
    mapping(address => uint256) public collateral;

    constructor(address _oracle) {
        oracle = IPriceFeed(_oracle);
    }

    function borrow(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 price = oracle.getPrice(token);
        require(collateral[msg.sender] * price >= amount, "Undercollateralized");
        // Issue loan logic
    }
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. Attacker identifies that the price feed uses a low-liquidity AMM pair.
2. Attacker performs large buy/sell to skew the price of the token.
3. Calls borrow() using artificially inflated collateral value.
4. Withdraws loaned tokens at the manipulated price, then reverses the price manipulation.

**Assumptions:**

- Oracle is based on TWAP or spot price of an AMM like Uniswap  with low liquidity.
- Borrow/loan logic relies directly on unverified price inputs.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

contract SaferLending {
    IPriceFeed public chainlinkOracle;

    constructor(address _oracle) {
        chainlinkOracle = IPriceFeed(_oracle);
    }

    function borrow(address token, uint256 amount) external {
        uint256 price = chainlinkOracle.getPrice(token); // Uses secure, external oracle
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        // Collateral logic...
    }
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "DeFi protocol using DEX spot price for collateralization"
  severity: C
  reasoning: "Attacker can drain funds using temporary price manipulation."
- context: "Protocol uses Chainlink or TWAPs with update delay"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "Risk reduced by average pricing and delayed updates."
- context: "Price only used for UI or non-critical analytics"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Low impact if not involved in fund-moving logic."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Use decentralized oracles like Chainlink, Redstone, or UMA.
- Rely on TWAPs with sufficient duration to avoid short-term manipulation.
- Avoid direct use of low-liquidity AMM pairs as price feeds.

### Additional Safeguards

- Add circuit breakers or sanity checks on extreme price changes.
- Use multi-oracle aggregation with median or weighted average logic.
- Consider governance delays for price-sensitive operations.

### Detection Methods

- Analyze oracle dependency and source trustworthiness.
- Use Slither detectors for untrusted-oracle and price-manipulation.
- Simulate oracle price impact with fuzzing or adversarial testing.

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Can directly lead to protocol insolvency or massive bad debt.

- **Exploitability**: Commonly exploitable on thin-liquidity pairs or unverified TWAPs.

- **Reachability**: Oracle data is usually directly queried in user-facing functions.

- **Complexity**: Requires moderate setup (manipulate AMM pool or data feed).

- **Detectability**: Detectable in code reviews, but often missed in data flow audits.
