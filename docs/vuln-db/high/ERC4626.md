baseSeverity: H
category: accounting

impact: Mispriced shares, loss of user funds, or broken vault logic
status: draft
complexity: medium

versions: [">=0.8.0", "<=0.8.25"]
cwe: CWE-682
swc: SWC-135
```

## 📝 Description

- ERC-4626 is a standardized interface for yield-bearing vaults that tokenizes user deposits into shares. Implementing this standard incorrectly—particularly the conversion math between assets and shares—can lead to:
- Rounding errors that compound over time
- Unfair share issuance (underpricing or overpricing)
- Incorrect redemption behavior (withdrawals exceeding vault assets)
- Economic imbalances between early and late users
- Common causes of bugs include:
- Integer division without rounding control
- Unchecked edge cases when totalSupply == 0
- Asset/share misalignment during fee handling or rebasing

## 🚨 Vulnerable Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BrokenVault {
    uint256 public totalAssets;
    uint256 public totalShares;

    function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (assets * totalShares) / totalAssets; // ❌ division by 0 if empty vault
    }

    function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view returns (uint256) {
        return (shares * totalAssets) / totalShares;
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Exploit Scenario

1. Vault is freshly deployed with totalAssets == 0 and totalShares == 0.
2. First user deposits 100 tokens.
3. The vault incorrectly mints zero shares due to division rounding to zero.
4. Subsequent users get full-value shares, and the initial depositor cannot withdraw.
5. Alternatively, early users may get all shares, diluting future users unfairly.

**Assumptions:**

- Vault does not implement ERC4626’s initialization safety check for zero supply.
- No precision-aware rounding or safety guards are in place.

## ✅ Fixed Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol";

contract SafeVault is ERC4626 {
    constructor(IERC20 asset_) ERC4626(asset_) {}

    function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _supply = totalSupply();
        return (_supply == 0) ? assets : (assets * _supply) / totalAssets();
    }

    function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _supply = totalSupply();
        return (_supply == 0) ? shares : (shares * totalAssets()) / _supply;
    }
}
```
## 🧭 Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Vault governs user deposits and redemptions without input validation"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "User funds may be trapped or extracted unfairly"
- context: "Vault uses OpenZeppelin 4626 with basic checks"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "Still prone to rounding and edge case bugs"
- context: "Vault includes floor liquidity, rounding protection, and unit tests"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Risk minimized if fully hardened"
```

## 🛡️ Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Always guard against totalAssets == 0 and totalShares == 0.
- Use OpenZeppelin’s ERC4626 reference implementation unless there is a strong reason not to.

### Additional Safeguards

- Write fuzz tests for share/asset conversion functions (convertToAssets, convertToShares, previewDeposit, previewRedeem)
- Validate initial minting behavior with property-based testing (e.g., Foundry, Echidna).

### Detection Methods

- Search for convertToShares and convertToAssets implementations without fallback logic.
- Tools: Slither, MythX, invariant testing

## 📄 Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Loss of user funds, broken accounting, unfair share ratios.
- **Exploitability**: Can be triggered by any depositor if vault isn't protected.
- **Reachability**: Applies to all vaults implementing custom ERC4626 logic.
- **Complexity**: Not complex but easy to overlook.
- **Detectability**: Detected via fuzzing, property testing, or static checks.
