```YAML
id: TBA
title: Uninitialized Storage Pointers 
baseSeverity: H
category: storage-pointer
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Overwriting unrelated contract storage variables
status: draft
complexity: medium
attack_vector: internal
mitigation_difficulty: easy
versions: [">=0.4.0", "<0.8.21"]
cwe: CWE-824
swc: SWC-109
```

## üìù Description

- Uninitialized storage pointers in Solidity can cause serious and unpredictable behavior.
- When a storage reference (e.g., `Struct s;`) is declared without the `memory` or `storage` keyword inside a function, Solidity defaults to storage slot `0`, which may overwrite important variables such as `owner`, `balances`, or mappings. 
- This leads to **unintended storage collisions** and potential total compromise of the contract‚Äôs logic or access control.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity
struct User {
    uint256 balance;
    bool isWhitelisted;
}

contract UninitializedPointer {
    mapping(address => User) public users;
    address public owner;

    function initUser() public {
        User user; // ‚ùå uninitialized storage pointer
        user.balance = 100;
        user.isWhitelisted = true;
    }
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. Function initUser() is called.
2. The uninitialized User user; pointer defaults to storage slot 0.
3. This overwrites owner and corrupts mappings like users[msg.sender].
4. Ownership is lost and mappings may become inaccessible or invalid.

**Assumptions:**

- Storage pointer declared without memory or storage.
- Contract has critical variables stored in early slots.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

function initUser() public {
    User memory user; // ‚úÖ proper memory allocation
    user.balance = 100;
    user.isWhitelisted = true;

    users[msg.sender] = user; // save to actual storage mapping
}
```
## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Default"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "Allows overwriting of critical storage slots leading to privilege or logic corruption."
- context: "Contracts using proxy patterns"
  severity: C
  reasoning: "Storage slot overwrites can break upgradeable logic or admin controls."
- context: "Contracts with tight manual storage layout"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "Less likely if design ensures sensitive slots are isolated."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Always declare whether struct or array variables in functions are memory or storage.
- Avoid using Struct s; inside functions without explicit location.

### Additional Safeguards

- Use linters or Slither to detect uninitialized storage.
- Write tests to check that storage layout remains intact.

### Detection Methods

- Slither: uninitialized-storage and storage-pointer detectors.
- Mythril symbolic analysis can identify overwritten storage slots.
- Manual audit of any struct or array declarations in internal logic.

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Corrupts important variables like ownership or balances.
- **Exploitability**: Triggered by any external caller if the function is public.
- **Reachability**: Common in user setup functions or admin initializers.
- **Complexity**: Simple call; attacker does not need a contract.
- **Detectability**: Detected by tools like Slither; human audits often overlook it unless explicitly tested.
