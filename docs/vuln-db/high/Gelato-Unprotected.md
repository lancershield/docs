id: TBA
title: Gelato Unprotected Randomness 
baseSeverity: H
category: randomness
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Lottery rigging, reward abuse, or outcome predictability
status: draft
complexity: medium

cwe: CWE-338
swc: SWC-120
```

## üìù Description

- Gelato is a decentralized automation protocol that offers task execution infrastructure for smart contracts. 
- Some developers use Gelato to schedule or automate functions like lottery draws or airdrops. However, using Gelato‚Äôs execution time or transaction context as a randomness source‚Äîsuch as block.timestamp, tx.origin, or block.number‚Äîwithout cryptographic protections introduces deterministic randomness, which can be:
- Predicted off-chain before execution
- Manipulated by bots or miners front-running the Gelato executor
- Exploited to ensure favorable outcomes in lotteries, draws, or reward assignments
- This results in economic manipulation, unfair outcomes, or integrity violations in supposedly random selection processes.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract InsecureRandomGame {
    address public winner;

    function pickWinner(address[] memory players) external {
        require(players.length > 0, "No players");

        // ‚ùå Predictable randomness based on timestamp
        uint256 rand = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.number)));
        winner = players[rand % players.length];
    }
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

1. A lottery game uses Gelato to automate the pickWinner() function.
2. The randomness is derived from block.timestamp at execution.
3. A bot simulates the function off-chain for upcoming blocks and finds the winning condition.
4. It ensures Gelato runs the task in a block where the outcome is favorable or reorders player addresses in their favor.
5. They win the reward repeatedly or prevent fair distribution.

**Assumptions:**

- Gelato automates execution of functions that rely on block values for randomness.
- No verifiable randomness or commit-reveal is used.
- Attackers can observe or influence block parameters.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

// Recommended: Use Chainlink VRF or similar verifiable randomness provider

// Example integration
contract SecureRandomGame {
    address public winner;
    bytes32 public keyHash;
    uint64 public subscriptionId;
    VRFCoordinatorV2Interface COORDINATOR;

    constructor(address vrfCoordinator, bytes32 _keyHash, uint64 _subscriptionId) {
        COORDINATOR = VRFCoordinatorV2Interface(vrfCoordinator);
        keyHash = _keyHash;
        subscriptionId = _subscriptionId;
    }

    function requestRandomWinner(address[] memory players) external {
        uint256 requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords(
            keyHash,
            subscriptionId,
            3,
            200000,
            1
        );
        // Store players in temp storage...
    }

    function fulfillRandomWords(uint256, uint256[] memory randomWords) internal {
        uint256 rand = randomWords[0];
        winner = players[rand % players.length];
    }
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Randomness tied to reward, winner selection, or economic logic"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "Attackers can predict or manipulate outcomes, draining incentives"
- context: "Randomness used for low-value cosmetic effects"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Impact minimal; only affects UI or animations"
- context: "Randomness sourced from secure oracle or VRF"
  severity: I
  reasoning: "Vulnerability fully mitigated"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Never use block.timestamp, blockhash, tx.origin, or similar for randomness.
- Integrate Chainlink VRF or trusted randomness sources (e.g., RANDAO).

### Additional Safeguards

- Use commit-reveal schemes for user-submitted randomness.
- Validate randomness post-execution using cryptographic proofs.

### Detection Methods

- Search for use of block.timestamp, block.number, or abi.encodePacked(...) used for randomness.
- Tools: Slither (weak-prng), MythX, manual analysis of randomness design
