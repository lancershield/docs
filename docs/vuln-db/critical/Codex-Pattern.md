# Codex Pattern Vulnerability

```YAML
id: TBA
title: Codex Pattern Vulnerability 
baseSeverity: C
category: access-control
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Unauthorized reads/writes of shared state
status: draft
complexity: medium
attack_vector: internal
mitigation_difficulty: medium
versions: [">=0.4.0", "<=0.8.25"]
cwe: CWE-284
swc: SWC-135
```

## üìù Description

- The Codex Pattern‚Äîpopularized in systems like MakerDAO‚Äîuses a centralized "Codex" contract to manage shared state across modules (e.g., vault balances, permissions, or collateral settings). 
- Modules interact with this central Codex using delegatecall to manipulate the calling contract‚Äôs storage using the Codex‚Äôs logic.
- While powerful, this pattern is highly dangerous if:
- Codex contract addresses are not hardcoded or immutable
- No access control exists on who can call delegatecall()
- Codex logic is upgradeable or externally managed
- Storage layouts differ between caller and delegate
- This leads to critical risk of storage corruption, arbitrary writes, or privilege escalation, especially if a malicious module or address becomes the target of a delegatecall.

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Codex {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function modifyBalance(address user, int256 delta) external {
        balances[user] = uint256(int256(balances[user]) + delta); // ‚ùå No access control
    }
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

1. The protocol uses Codex to store collateral and debt balances.
2. A malicious actor calls modifyBalance(attacker, 1000000) directly.
3. The balance is updated without permission or validation.
4. The attacker now withdraws excess collateral or borrows funds illegitimately.

**Assumptions:**

- Protocol assumes Codex is only used by trusted modules (e.g., Vault, Borrower).
- There is no whitelist or role-checking on Codex modification functions.
- Attack surface is exposed through direct external access.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Codex {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => bool) public trustedModules;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyModule() {
        require(trustedModules[msg.sender], "unauthorized");
        _;
    }

    function addModule(address module) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "not owner");
        trustedModules[module] = true;
    }

    function modifyBalance(address user, int256 delta) external onlyModule {
        balances[user] = uint256(int256(balances[user]) + delta);
    }
}
```

## üß≠ Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Codex address is upgradable or externally controlled"
  severity: C
  reasoning: "Allows total control of storage‚Äîcritical protocol compromise."
- context: "Codex is immutable but logic differs in layout"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "Storage corruption possible even without malicious intent."
- context: "Codex is audited, immutable, and layout-aligned"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Pattern is safe if strictly enforced and tested."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Implement strict access control for all Codex mutating functions.
- Treat Codex as internal storage layer, not a generic external contract.

### Additional Safeguards

- Use internal calls (delegatecall, call) gated by trusted modules.
- Separate public getters from mutation logic.
- Implement upgradeability carefully to prevent logic substitution attacks.

### Detection Methods

- Scan for external/public functions that mutate Codex state without require(msg.sender == X) or onlyRole(...).
- Check Codex contracts for missing trust boundaries.
- Tools: Slither (access-control, missing-auth), manual module inspection

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Unchecked writes to Codex state break accounting and trust assumptions.
- **Exploitability**: Easy to exploit if functions are callable and unguarded.
- **Reachability**: Codex is public and callable in most modular systems.
- **Complexity**: Vulnerability is subtle due to logic separation across modules.
- **Detectability**: Easy to miss unless specifically validating access to Codex state mutators.
