# ðŸŸ  Medium Severity

- May result in limited financial impact under specific conditions but usually not catastrophic.

- Exploitation often requires multiple conditions to align, such as specific user behavior or system state.

- Might affect functionality or reliability without directly causing fund loss.

- Could lead to privilege escalation or indirect manipulation if chained with other vulnerabilities.

- Not easily exploitable on its own, but might be used in multi-step attacks.

- Fixes are important but may not require immediate emergency response.

- Often discovered during thorough audits, not immediately obvious in casual reviews.

- May degrade user trust if exploited, even if impact is moderate.

- Includes misconfigurations, improper checks, and outdated logic that could become critical over time.

- Should be prioritized for patching after high severity issues are addressed to reduce compound risk.
