# Public Mappings 

```YAML
id: TBA
title: Public Mappings
baseSeverity: M
category: data-leakage
language: solidity
blockchain: [ethereum]
impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive information via auto-generated getter
status: draft
complexity: low
attack_vector: external
mitigation_difficulty: easy
versions: [">=0.4.0", "<=0.8.25"]
cwe: CWE-200
swc: SWC-136
```

## 📝 Description

- In Solidity, declaring a mapping as public automatically generates a getter function for it. 
- However, when the mapping contains nested types (such as structs, arrays, or other mappings), the auto-generated getter allows external users to retrieve internal state values on-demand, exposing potentially sensitive data.
- While this is not a vulnerability in all contexts, it becomes critical when:
- The nested data includes sensitive business logic (e.g., votes, KYC status, secret salts).
- The mapping is assumed to be “internal-only” due to its type or naming.
- Access control checks are bypassed unintentionally due to auto-exposure.

## 🚨 Vulnerable Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VoteTracker {
    struct Vote {
        bool hasVoted;
        uint8 choice;
    }

    mapping(address => Vote) public votes; // ❌ Public mapping exposes Vote struct
}
```

## 🧪 Exploit Scenario

1. A contract implements a voting system with Vote structs mapped per user.
2. The mapping is declared public to enable internal read access (e.g., votes[msg.sender]).
3. An attacker or curious user queries votes(victimAddress) directly via the generated getter.
4. Sensitive data like vote choices or flags are publicly revealed.

**Assumptions:**

- Developers are unaware of the full implications of public on mappings.
- Sensitive data is nested under mappings assumed to be internally scoped.
- No external access guard is applied to the getter.

## ✅ Fixed Code

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SecureVoteTracker {
    struct Vote {
        bool hasVoted;
        uint8 choice;
    }

    mapping(address => Vote) internal votes; // ✅ Internal prevents external access

    function hasVoted(address user) external view returns (bool) {
        return votes[user].hasVoted;
    }
}
```

## 🧭 Contextual Severity

```yaml
- context: "Default"
  severity: M
  reasoning: "Can lead to sensitive data exposure and governance manipulation in common use cases."
- context: "Public DeFi Protocol with token-based voting"
  severity: H
  reasoning: "Vote buying, stake-based manipulation, or airdrop sybil attacks possible."
- context: "Private/internal app with low user count"
  severity: L
  reasoning: "Limited damage; user addresses likely known or non-sensitive."
```

## 🛡️ Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Do not mark nested mappings or mappings of structs as public if data confidentiality is expected.
- Use custom getter functions with access control as needed.

### Additional Safeguards

- Restrict contract functions to return redacted or masked data.
- Design mappings with visibility expectations explicitly documented.
- Consider zero-knowledge or hash-based storage for privacy-critical logic.

### Detection Methods

- Search for public mapping(address => Struct) or similar patterns.
- Check if nested values expose user privacy, choices, or business-critical flags.
- Tools: Slither (public-mapping-struct rule), manual audit

## 📄 Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Reveals sensitive or strategic information; affects fairness or integrity.
- **Exploitability**: Simple external call retrieves supposedly private data.
- **Reachability**: Fully exposed via public getter generated by Solidity.
- **Complexity**: Low-complexity coding mistake; misunderstood visibility semantics.
- **Detectability**: Easy to overlook unless audit explicitly checks visibility of mappings.
