# ðŸ”¥ Critical Severity

- Represents the highest risk level in vulnerability classification.

- Exploits can lead to complete loss of funds, contract bricking, or governance takeover.

- Vulnerabilities are often immediately exploitable post-deployment.

- Impact affects not only individual users but entire protocols and ecosystems.

- These issues must be patched immediatelyâ€”delays can be catastrophic.

- Exploits are typically irreversible on-chain, leading to permanent damage.

- Attackers may gain full admin control or bypass all user restrictions.

- Often result in protocol shutdowns, forks, or emergency withdrawals.

- May attract legal, regulatory, or reputational fallout.

- Examples: reentrancy flaws, logic bugs in withdrawal functions, broken access control.
