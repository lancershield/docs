cwe: CWE-284
swc: SWC-135
```

## üìù Description

- Token Whitelisting Flaws occur when protocols rely on a whitelist to determine which ERC20 tokens are allowed in specific functions (e.g., swaps, staking, rewards, vaults), but fail to enforce, validate, or update the whitelist securely. Common issues include:
- Tokens not being properly validated against the whitelist
- Tokens whitelisted but later replaced via proxies
- Tokens with unexpected transfer behavior (e.g., fee-on-transfer) that bypass assumptions
- Contracts using transferFrom() or transfer() without whitelist enforcement

## üö® Vulnerable Code

```solidity

mapping(address => bool) public isWhitelisted;

function deposit(address token, uint256 amount) external {
    // ‚ùå Missing check: isWhitelisted[token]
    IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
}
```

## üß™ Exploit Scenario

Step-by-step exploit process:

1. Protocol claims to only accept whitelisted tokens, but forgets to enforce require(isWhitelisted[token]).
2. Attacker deploys a malicious ERC20 token that always returns true for transferFrom() but doesn't actually transfer any tokens.
3. They call deposit() with their fake token.
4. Protocol records a deposit, triggering unearned rewards or share issuance.
5. Attacker calls withdraw() or claim(), receiving real assets (e.g., ETH, USDC).

**Assumptions:**

- The protocol uses whitelists for accepted tokens but does not enforce them at the point of usage.
- The attacker can supply custom or malicious tokens with ERC20 interfaces.
- There is no validation of actual transfer success or balance deltas.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Code

```solidity

function deposit(address token, uint256 amount) external {
    require(isWhitelisted[token], "Token not approved");
    uint256 before = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    uint256 after_ = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(after_ - before == amount, "Token transfer mismatch");
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

### Primary Defenses

- Always check whitelist status (require(isWhitelisted[token])) in every function accepting tokens.
- Validate token behavior using balance deltas, not just return values.
- Reject non-standard or unverified tokens, especially those with delegatecall, mint, or transferFrom overrides.

### Additional Safeguards

- Lock the whitelist with governance voting or timelock before protocol launch.
- Use immutable registries or hash-based token validation (e.g., hashed bytecode).
- Simulate transfers with known tokens in testnet forks and coverage tools.

### Detection Methods

- Static analysis: missing require(isWhitelisted[token]) or unchecked token usage.
- Runtime monitoring of unexpected token addresses or abnormal transferFrom() behavior.
- Tools: Slither (unchecked-token), MythX, Echidna fuzzing for ERC20 edge cases

## üìÑ Justifications & Analysis

- **Impact**: Can directly compromise user funds or inflate rewards via fake tokens.
- **Exploitability**: Attacker simply needs to deploy and interact with a malicious ERC20.
- **Reachability**: Common in DeFi vaults, farms, or swaps accepting user-supplied token addresses.
- **Complexity**: Low to medium‚Äîdeploy fake token or exploit proxy mutation.
- **Detectability**: Detectable via access control, input validation, and token behavior testing.
